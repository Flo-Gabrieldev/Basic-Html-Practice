                <p>Time management is often the one thing holding us back from picking up new hobbies, shooting for an exciting promotion,
                changing careers, going back to school - in short, achieving the things that we really want to do with our lives.
                So, if it holds such transformational potential for us, why aren’t we all working on it? Scratch that: why aren’t
                we all obsessed with it? Well, in short, because time management is hard. And not just from the perspective of learning
                how to plan, prioritize, decide, and delegate.Our time management struggles can stem from 
                all manner of complex causes - from how and why we get distracted, to the personal beliefs we hold about ourselves and whether our work is good enough.</p>
